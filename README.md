# Retail-recommender-system
Recommender system, several ones, based on different algorithms and approaches

First download files from main/Data, save it somewhere
Then in notebooks carefully read comment, somewhere you'll be need to insert those saved files in cells for pipeline to work

Maximum score (which is MAP@k metrics) was provided by the Naive Recommender but in only counts most popular purchases. Similar scores, slightly lower were provided by Neural Network algo (~0.25-0.27) and it actually recommends something.
